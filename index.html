            Travelling
        </h3>
        <p>
            Travelling is going to different places instead of staying at the place we are from.There are different modes of transporation to travel.
            Personally,I enjoy travelling a lot because it allows me to learn about <b>different places</b>, <b>cultures</b> and <b>different kind of lifestyles.</b>
            Besides, it helps me recuperate from the stress of my private life as well as the boredom of following the monotonous daily routines of my life.
